- 👋 Hi, I’m @phinehas90 also Corey Kohler
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. I live in Colorado, so all of the typical outdoorsy stuff: snowboarding, mountain biking, kayaking, hiking, drinking beer
at a barbecue. I also love to play pool as well as chess - accepting challenges to either.
- 🌱 (Broadly) I’m currently learning React and Python - mainly just best programming practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can learn something.
- 📫 Feel free to contact me through my email: kohler.nai@gmail.com or on LinkedIN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-kohler-880997149/
